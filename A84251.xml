            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>ABout the fifteenth of this preſent Month of May, it happened
that ſome Ships of <hi>Southampton,</hi> who had beene long at ſea, were
making homeward and by the caſualty of the weather and wind, were forced upon
the Iriſh Coaſt, where they lay untill a better opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was given unto
them to make home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which according to their long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation was at
length offered unto them No ſooner almoſt had they looſed Anchor and
hoyſed ſayle, not having ſayled three leagues, but preſently they
eſpied two ſtrange Barkes, making with all poſſible ſpeed they could
towards <hi>Ireland,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Southampton</hi> perceiving what they
were, <pb facs="tcp:156751:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 49 -->were very deſirous to know
whether they were bound, whereupon they halled them but received but rugged and
ſmall ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, upon this ſtubborne anſwer they let flye at them,
ſtriving to force from them what they could not obtaine by a faire demand:
The <hi>Dunkirks</hi> anſwered them againe, but were not able to abide long
in oppoſition, but fearing their own power, endeavoured to ſecure their
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent hopes by flight, which they were in good hope to obtaine by the
nimbleneſſe of their Pinnaces; their flight they did endeavour, and the
purſuit of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary was as violently proſecuted, they were ſo
hard chaſed that the happineſſe of the wind forced them to take that way
whither thtſe <hi>Southampton</hi> men were bound and at the length they were
driven by the wind and the enemie into the Harbour of <hi>Southampton,</hi>
where they now ſtay, and ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and found to bee laden with great
ſtore of Powder, for of that kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion conſiſted all their
lading, and being examined whether they were to tranſport 
<pb facs="tcp:156751:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 49 -->that commodity, they boldly
anſwered, That they were ſent to ſupply the Lord <hi>Mountgarret</hi> and
his Forces in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who they underſtood had very much neede of
that kinde of proviſion; upon this cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion the ſhipping were
ſtayed, and the Coods ſeized upon, and the men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtayed in
<hi>Southampton,</hi> untill it ſhall be further determined of them. Thus it
